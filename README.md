# abqvotes


This project is still under construction.

It takes data from both a City of Albuquerque (CABQ) API and a University of New Mexico API to display
spatial and other information about all voting locations.  It allows the user to quickly filter the data, sort it by the
nearest locations, or find ones with the shortest estimated wait times.  View the issue tracker for features still
